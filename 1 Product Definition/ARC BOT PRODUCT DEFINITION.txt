Product Definition Revision 0.2 Date 9/6/2017INTRODUCTION :	
	- The arc bot project is a product to show how embedded system control and DSP help achieve mechanical motor movements based on human input. 

PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS :
		- DEFINED AREA FOR DRAWING AN ARC.	- DSP FOR PRECISE MOTOR MOVEMENTS	- EMBEDDED CODE FOR OPERATING LOGIC FEATURE LIST :
	A - POWER SUPPLY REGULATOR

	Characteristics:
		-STEP DOWN AND FILTER AC INPUT 
		-Fixed DC output voltage FOR CONTROLLER, MOTOR DRIVER.
		-Fulfills Total Current Requirement Of System
B - AUDRIO CONTROLLER BOARD 

	characteristics:
		-TO PROVIDE LOGIC AND CONTROL TO PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MOTOR
		-INPUT FROM LIMIT SENSOR 
		-POWER TO LIMIT SENSOR

C - TO MOTOR DRIVERS

	characteristics:
		- INPUT FROM AUDRINO
		- POWER AND CONTROL TO STEPPER MOTOR
		-
D - MOTORS 

	characteristics:
		-PRIMARY MOTOR
		-SECONDARY MOTOR
		-CONNECTED ON THE SAME ARM, RESEMBLING AN ELBOW AND WRIST JOINT.
		-DETERMINES THE RANGE OF ARM MOTION
		-SLOW SPEED

E - STEPPER MOTORS FOR HAVING PRECISE CONTROL MOVEMENTS

	characteristics:
		-MOVEMENT OF ARM
F - SENOR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND OPERATIONAL LIMIT SIGNALS.	characteristics:
		-SECONDARY FEEDBACK TO CONTROL OPERATION

G - Joystick

	characteristics:
		-ACCEPTS ANALOG HUMAN INPUT 
		-CONVERTS ANALOG TO DIGITAL SIGNAL FOR CONTROLLER

F - Inscription

	characteristics:
		-LED PENCIL WITH FIXED CONNECTION TO ARM
		-CONTINUOUSLY TOUCHING THE DRAWING SURFACEBEHAVIOR DEFINITION  	STATES 	1 Ð HOMING  (INITIAL POSITION)
		A.POWER UP 
		B. MOVE TO IDLE STATE

	2 - IDLE  (AWAIT SIGNAL TO CONTINUE OPERATION)
		A. NO ACTION 
		B.  HUMAN INPUT MOVE TO STATE1 (STATE 1 ONLY BEAUSE ASSUMING FAR LEFT POSIITION AS HOMING POSITION)
	3 Ð FORWARD MOVEMENT (DIRECTION 1)
		A.MOVE RIGHT RELATIVE TO MOTOR POSITION
		B. MOVE TO STATE 4 OR MOVE TO IDLE STATE 2 OR MOVE TO STATE 1 
	4 Ð BACKWARD MOVEMENT (DIRECTION 2)
		A.MOVE LEFT RELATIVE TO MOTOR POSITION
		B. MOVE TO STATE 3 OR MOVE TO STATE IDLE STATE 2 OR MOVE TO STATE 1

	5 -ERROR STATE (NO OPERATION, CAUSES WATCHDOG TIME SUBROUTINE)
		A. IN BETWEEN STATE 3 AND 4 DETECTS NO ACTIVITY 
		B. RESET AND RETURN TO HOMING STATE. 	EVENTS 	A - JOYSTICK INPUT (TRIGGER)
		A. ARM POSITION CHANGE
	B - LIMIT SENSOR INPUT (TRIGGER)
		A. BOUNDRY CONDITION DETECT	 DETAILED BEHAVIOR
 		- POWER ON CAUSES THE ARM TO MOVE TO THE START POINT 
	- AWAIT FURTHER INPUT 	- USER DEFINES MOVEMENT CHANGE IN STATE
	- STATE CHANGE / DIRECTION AND MOVEMENT 
	- DETECT LIMIT / FEEDBACK FROM LIMIT SENOR CHANGE IN SATE 
	- ERROR STATE DUE TO INACTIVITY CHANGE STATE	- SENSOR TRIGGERS SIGNAL WHEN MECHANICAL ARM LIMITS ARE REACHED HELPING CONTROLLER TO DECIDE TO GET THE ARM BACK TO PREVIOUS OR SAFE STATE.
