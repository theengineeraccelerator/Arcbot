Product Definition Revision 0.1 Date 8/25/207Introduction 	- The arc bot project is a product to show how embedded system control and DSP help achieve mechanical motor movements based on human input. The scope of this project covers detailed design, assembly, testing of an arc bot that accepts input from a JOYSTICK.    Product Characteristics 	- PHYSICAL COVERAGE AREA FOR DRAWING AN ARC.- Signal processing FOR MOTOR SPEED CONTROL COMBINED WITH FEEDBACK FOR PRECISE MOVEMENTS- EMBEDDED CODE FOR IMPLEMENTING OPERATING LOGIC Feature List 	- POWER SUPPLY REGULATOR TO STEP DOWN AND FILTER AC INPUT TO A FIXED AND REGULATED DC VOLTAGE FOR CONTROLLER, MOTOR DRIVER.- AUDRIO CONTROLLER BOARD TO PROVIDE LOGIC AND CONTROL SIGNAL TO MOTOR DRIVERS AND POWER TO SENSOR- MOTOR DRIVERS TO PROVIDE SIGNAL AND POWER TO STEPPER MOTORS- STEPPER MOTORS FOR HAVING PRECISE CONTROL MOVEMENTS- SENOR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND OPERATIONAL LIMIT SIGNALS.Behavior Definition  	States Ð HOMING  (INITIAL POSITION)Ð FORWARD MOVEMENT (DIRECTION 1)Ð BACKWARD MOVEMENT (DIRECTION 2)  	Events - JOYSTICK INPUT (TRIGGER)- SENSOR INPUT (TRIGGER)  	 Product States 	- STARTUP - NORMAL OPERATIONAL STATE - ERROR STATEDetailed Behavior 	- POWER ON CAUSES THE ARM TO MOVE TO THE START POINT WAITING FOR FURTHER INPUT FROM A USER- USER DEFINES MOVEMENT IN EITHER DIRECTION WHICH TRIGGERS A FORWARD OR BACKWARD MOVEMENT OF ARM- SENSOR TRIGGERS SIGNAL WHEN MECHANICAL ARM LIMITS ARE REACHED HELPING CONTROLLER TO DECIDE TO GET THE ARM BACK TO PREVIOUS OR SAFE STATE.
