Product Definition Revision 0.1 Date 8/25/207Introduction 	- The arc bot project is a product to show how embedded system control and DSP help achieve mechanical motor movements based on human input. The scope of this project covers detailed design, assembly, testing of an arc bot that accepts input from a JOYSTICK.    Product Characteristics 	- PHYSICAL COVERAGE AREA FOR DRAWING AN ARC.- be more precise. For example  "Drawing area size"************* These are not characteristic that apply to the whole product but to specific features *********- Signal processing FOR MOTOR SPEED CONTROL COMBINED WITH FEEDBACK FOR PRECISE MOVEMENTS- EMBEDDED CODE FOR IMPLEMENTING OPERATING LOGIC ************* These are not characteristic that apply to the whole product *********Feature List 	- POWER SUPPLY REGULATOR 	Characteristics 	- TO STEP DOWN AND FILTER AC INPUT TO A FIXED 	- REGULATED DC VOLTAGE FOR CONTROLLER, MOTOR DRIVER.	- ??Anything else? - AUDRIO CONTROLLER BOARD 	Characteristics 	- PROVIDE LOGIC AND CONTROL SIGNAL TO MOTOR DRIVERS 	- POWER TO SENSOR	- ??Anything else?  - MOTOR DRIVERS 	Characteristics 	- PROVIDE SIGNAL AND POWER TO STEPPER MOTORS	- ??Anything else?  - STEPPER MOTORS 	Characteristics 	- HAVING PRECISE CONTROL MOVEMENTS	- ??Anything else?  Resolution ?? Speed ??- SESNOR - ??	Characteristics 	- FEEDBACK AND OPERATIONAL LIMIT SIGNALS.	- Anything else?  - ??? Joystick missing ???Behavior Definition  	States Ð HOMING  (INITIAL POSITION)?? IDLE ?? - WAITING FOR FURTHER INPUT FROM A USERÐ FORWARD MOVEMENT (DIRECTION 1)Ð BACKWARD MOVEMENT (DIRECTION 2)  	Events - JOYSTICK INPUT (TRIGGER) - the joystick will send continuous input so this is not a event. This of a threshold of some kind- SENSOR INPUT (TRIGGER)  	 Product States - Redundant?? from the States section above- STARTUP - NORMAL OPERATIONAL STATE - ERROR STATEDetailed Behavior 	Initial State: HOMEING	Event: Power Up		- THE ARM TO MOVE TO THE START POINT 		- Go to IDLE StateInitial State: IDLE 	Event: Joystick changes position		- Update arm position	Event: Sensor limit hit		- ?? What happens??
